Using it with `Fitbit`
------
You should attach your fitbit device to profile
before you can use it with demo. Todo this you should download
fitbit app on your phone and log in using this credentials: 
  - username nechyporchuk@gmail.com
  - password u134zp2n
After that you have to attach yout device using this app.
Then you are ready to use your device with demo.

You should use demo hoseted on [this](http://vpn2.waveaccess.kiev.ua:17405) url.
The fitbit items is added to the *patient* section.

There are three fitbit measures in the demo:
  - Body weight
  - Body fat
  - Steps
The first two can be measured using `Smart Scale`. Steps can be
measured using `Fitbit Flex` wristband. You can measure Weight (or other measures)
only once per day. If you do this several times per day your timeline item will be updated.

The data from fitbit device is synced with some delay. So to sync it faster you can manualy do this
by clicking 'Synchronize' button in your phone app. After that you should refresh page with timeline.
If your measure is first for this day, then you'll see new timeline item. If it's not first - you should 
click on item for this day to see the updated value.
